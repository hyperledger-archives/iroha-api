# Commands

A command changes the state, called World State View, by performing an action over an entity (asset, account) in the system. Any command should be included in a transaction to perform an action.

## Add asset quantity

### Purpose

The purpose of _add asset quantity_ command is to increase the quantity of an asset on account of transaction creator. Use case scenario is to increase the number of mutable asset in the system, which can act as a claim on a commodity (e.g. money, gold, etc.)

### Structure

```protobuf
message AddAssetQuantity {
    string account_id = 1;
    string asset_id = 2;
    Amount amount = 3;
}

message uint256 {
   uint64 first = 1;
   uint64 second = 2;
   uint64 third = 3;
   uint64 fourth = 4;
}

message Amount {
   uint256 value = 1;
   uint32 precision = 2;
}

```
```json
{
    "commands": [
        {
            "command_type": "AddAssetQuantity",
