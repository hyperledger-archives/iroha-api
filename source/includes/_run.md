# Run the daemon (irohad) 

## Create genesis block

A genesis block is the first block in the chain.

<b>Important:</b> each peer in the initialized network should have exactly the same genesis block, so create it once and distribute across peers. This block may have <b>any</b> data, as no-one validates it in the peer network.

### Using iroha-cli

#### Create list of peers
Create peers.list file containing network addresses of peers' internal ports in the network (`10001` by default) a single peer address goes on new line. If you want to run Iroha on single peer, it is sufficient to mention only localhost: <br> `$ echo 'localhost:10001' > peers.list`

As an example, for 4 peers the file will look like the following:
<ul>
  <li>10.128.13.1:10001</li>
  <li>10.128.13.2:10001</li>
  <li>10.128.13.3:10001</li>
  <li>10.128.13.4:10001</li>
</ul>

<aside class="notice">
Internal port is used for communication of internal components. Each peer potentially may have different, adjustable internal port numbers.

#### Use iroha-cli
Generate genesis block using iroha-cli (see shell command on the right side).

Iroha-cli tool is used to generate keypairs for every peer, mentioned in the peers list. This is done only for convenience — in production environment please consider using manual or more trusted approach.

> Generating genesis block

```bash
$ iroha-cli --genesis_block \ 
--peers_address peers.list
```
Executing this command will result in generation of following files:

* `admin@test.priv` and `admin@test.pub` — keypair for user with admin and asset creator rights
* `test@test.priv` and `test@test.pub` — keypair for user with user rights
* `node0.priv` and `node0.pub` — keypair for first node, mentioned in the `peers.list`
* If mentioned more than one peer address in `peers.list`: `nodeX.priv` and `nodeX.pub` — keypair for #X node, mentioned in the peers.list, (where X is starts from 1) 
* `genesis.block` — genesis block itself

<aside class="notice">
What are those asset creator, admin, user rights? Iroha supports role-based access control, so initial roles for accounts should be created in genesis block. Check <a href="#permission-model">permission model</a> section of the documentation to find out more.

### Manually

Follow JSON structure of the block, as it is reflected in [JSON schema for the block](https://gist.github.com/neewy/4e347bc8493951733998e01af633dbbb).

## Prepare configuration file

Configuration file keeps information about storage credentials and irohad parameters:

|-------------------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| block_store_path  | string  | Path to store blocks of committed transactions (flat file storage)                                                  |
| torii_port        | integer | Port to access iroha node gRPC (default 50051)                                                                      |
| internal_port     | integer | Port for communication between ordering service, YAC consensus and block loader for synchronization (default 10001) |
| pg_opt            | string  | Postgres credentials                                                                                                |
| max_proposal_size | integer | Maximum size of created proposals                                                                                   |
| proposal_delay    | integer | The period of time (in ms) used to prepare proposal of transactions                                                 |
| vote_delay        | integer | The period of time (in ms) of spreading vote across the network                                                     |
| load_delay        | integer | The period of time (in ms) between synchronizations between peers                                                   |

## Launch irohad

To launch irohad daemon, following parameters must be passed:

| Parameter     | Meaning                                                                                      |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| config        | configuration file, containing postgres connection and values to tune the system             |
| genesis_block | initial block in the ledger                                                                  |
| keypair_name  | private and public key file names without file extension. Used by peer to sign the blocks    |

Use this command to launch iroha:

`irohad --config example/config.sample --genesis_block example/genesis.block --keypair_name example/node0`
